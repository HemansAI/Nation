An Operating System built from scratch.


An OS is just the combination of Electrical Engineering and Data Structure and Algorithms.

Documentation is most important for building an OS. To do that there are two types of documnets:
1. Software Requirement Document
2. Software Specification Document


Software Requirement Document: It includes both the list of the requirements and a description of the problem domain.

Software Specification Document: It is a interface design, with constraints for the problem domain to follow. It states rules for the desired behavior of the output.
